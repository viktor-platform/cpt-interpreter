This sample app shows how to interpret a Cone Penetration Test (CPT) file as soil layout using a classification method
of choice:
- Robertson - optimized for Dutch soil
- Table method - custom classification

The goal of this app is to demonstrate how the VIKTOR platform is used in the geotechnical engineering industry. This
app is a simplified version of similar apps used by geotechnical engineers to analyze soil layouts. These analyses are
important for the construction industry, as many calculations rely on an accurate modelling of the soil.

Soil layouts are used in processes such as:
- soil bearing capacity calculations
- pile drive predictions
- designing structures that interact with the soil, such as quay wall, sheet piles, etc.

This app guides the user through a stepwise process:

1. Upload a .gef file
2. Choose the classification method
3. Classify the soil layout
4. Visualize the CPT interpretation

The interpretation results show the cone resistance, friction ratio, and soil layout over the depth of the CPT.
